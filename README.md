This is work in progress, but might work for some people.

The goal of Bugzilla Triage Helper is to provide an easy and standard interface to triaging bugs across the Firefox organization within Mozilla. This is in an early stage, we are giving it a try and looking for feedback.

### Configuration

Click the browser action button (its a blue ?) and go to the configuration page. Enter your email address. The tool will then automatically get the query to triage from Bugzilla based on that email address. Click update.

In a minute you'll notice that the count on the browser action will have changed from 0 to the number of bugs you have to triage. Sorry about that.

You can also set the tool to automatically submit after each use, this is not recommended until you comfortable with the extension.

Scroll down to get a list of the actions and what they do.

To return to the configuration page later, go to about:addons > Bugzilla Triage Helper > Preferences.

### Triaging

Click on the browser action button to go to your traige list. Proceed through the bugs as normal but notice there's a panel at the top right that gives you some options. These will alter the bug for you.

Each action can also be done through a keyboard shortcut, noted on the right of each action.
